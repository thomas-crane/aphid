## About

Aphid is a work in progress Discord library which was designed with TypeScript in mind.

You can read about what Aphid hopes to be in the [spec document.](docs/spec.md) It outlines the design and provides examples of the planned API of the project.

## Early development

This is the development branch of Aphid.

Although the spec is still not finalised, many of the core modules that Aphid uses can start to be created. This way, Aphid will have a solid and well tested foundation upon which the spec can be implemented.

Some of the core modules which are in progress now include the dependency injection system, and the `@Module` system.

## Acknowledgements

The way this library works is heavily inspired by how [Angular](https://angular.io/) works.

It also uses [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) as a base.
